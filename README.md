Utilizing OpenGL to render the graphics, this project generates a fun game to test your aiming skills!

In this game, you play as a hunter whose job is to get as many of the birds flying above you with your gun.

If a bird reaches the end of the screen on the left before it is shot, you lose!

The game utilizes keyboard input to start/end the game and to move the angle at which the gun shoots at.

The up and down keys are used to aim the gun and the space bar is to shoot bullets at the birds.

The birds + clouds are drawn with OpenGL and each have a timer as to how long it will stay on screen and how to update.

The birds each have their own speed and all progressively speed up as the game goes on to increase the difficulty!

There are 4 graphic classes used to create objects of type: Rect, Circle, FreeShape, and Shape to draw the game.

These classes are used to produce the background, birds, gun, bullets, bird falling animation, and user prompt screens.

Go ahead and set your own high score and be the best bird conservationist!
