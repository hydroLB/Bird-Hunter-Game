# 🎯 Bird Hunter Game: Test Your Aiming Skills! 🐦

## 📚 Overview
This exciting and visually engaging game was developed as part of Lisa Dion's Advanced Programming class in collaboration with fellow students Maxwell Hughes and Tai Kitazato. Using OpenGL for rendering graphics, the Bird Hunter game tests your aiming skills as you strive to protect the skies from pesky birds.

## 🎮 Gameplay
In Bird Hunter, you play as a skilled hunter with a mission to shoot as many birds as possible while they fly across the screen. But be careful! If a bird reaches the left end of the screen before you can shoot it down, it's game over.

The game utilizes keyboard input for controlling the action:

- Up and Down arrow keys: Aim the gun
- Spacebar: Shoot bullets at the birds

## 🦜 Dynamic Birds and Clouds ☁️
Birds and clouds are drawn using OpenGL, each with a timer that determines how long they remain on the screen and when they should update. The birds have different speeds, and as the game progresses, they become faster, increasing the difficulty and keeping you on your toes!

## 🎨 Graphics Classes
The game employs four graphics classes to create objects of various types, such as `Rect`, `Circle`, `FreeShape`, and `Shape`. These classes are used to generate the game's visuals, including:

- Background
- Birds
- Gun
- Bullets
- Bird falling animation
- User prompt screens
